Followed some tutorial back in 2005 to make a minimal kernel/operating system
that runs in an x86 machine and is bootable from a floppy disk. This is a
working result. Sadly I can't find the tutorial I used anymore, but most of
the code was lifted from there. Some new system commands were programmed in to
make it actually do something.

It worked on one of the computers at school as well as my one at home, so in
this sense it is 'portable'.
